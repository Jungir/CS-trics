C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld" mySQL //deamon
C:\> "C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqladmin" -u root shutdown //shut-down

======int 
NT is by default signed, INT (which is shorthand for INT SIGNED) therefore has the MAX VALUE of 2147483647.  INT UNSIGNED  is 0 to 4294967295.

You have to explicitly modify INT to get a different range. This is the same with all integer types; hence the confusion. They are both INT, but they are not technically the same.

They are both integers of type INT; so you could say 4294967295 is the largest available INT value.

You can compare this to CHAR vs VARHCHAR. Yes a CHAR is a string, as is VARCHAR; but it behaves differently than VARCHAR. One has a set amount of memory (CHAR), the other can vary its memory footprint (VARCHAR). They're both stings but they behave differently, because of a modification.

The largest integer (of any type) available in MySQL (currently) is BIGINT UNSIGNED at 9,223,372,036,854,775,807.
